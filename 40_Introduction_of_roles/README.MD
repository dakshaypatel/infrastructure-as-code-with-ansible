# Exercise 4: Introduction of roles

## Description: 

Now we come to the point, that the collection of lose playbooks become more and more complex and unclear to use.
To give them a more clear structure, we create a single playbook which uses self defined roles and a common set of variables and a inventory.


## Task:

1. Create a new project based on the ansible best practise project structure. 
2. The playbooks defined in the previous steps should refactored and added as roles. 
3. Create a inventory directory to handle different environments
4. Create one playbook which combine all roles into one flow. 

## Test

After running the playbook you should be able to call the petclinic with the url. 

     http://localhost:8080/
